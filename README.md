You are required to develop a real-time system using the Java programming language (Maven). The system should be able to:

  1.  Get a list of repositories from Github Issues. Refer to the link below for the testing purpose.
      https://github.com/STIW3054-A191/Assignments/issues/1

  2.  Download all the repositories from the list to your computer/laptop using Java threads.

  3.  Compile the Java program for each repository. If the Java program cannot be compiled, send the error messages to a log file. The name       of the log file MUST follow the following format.

      MatricNo.log (Example: 123456.log)

  4.  Run the program and store the output in a text file. The name of the output file MUST follow the following format.
       MatricNo.out (Example: 123456.out)

  5.  Generate software metrics using CKJM (https://www.spinellis.gr/sw/ckjm/) for each Java program and store the result in a text file.        The name of the text file MUST follow the following format.
       MatricNo.txt (Example: 123456.txt)

  6.  Store the accumulative metrics for all the Java programs in MS Excel. The example of the reporting format is shown below:


  7.  Generate a bar graph for each metric from the excel file and store all the graphs in a pdf file.

  8.  Calculate the execution time.
